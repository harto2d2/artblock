Personally I think of myself
as an aspiring artist and an
experienced one, this is because
I really want to find my own artstyle
which a lot of people have. For the

experienced one through the amount
of drawings I’ve done, tutorials I’ve
watched, and most importantly through
observation of artworks in social media.
Being influenced by a lot of artists on
social media I am always inspired to

make something even if it’s not even up
to my expectations. Just being able to
create something from my own hands is
enough. To be frank, all my artworks
didn’t turn out as I expected but it’s
definitely something I liked and
proud of.
